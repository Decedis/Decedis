- 👋 Hi, I’m @Decedis
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
    - Too many things. If there were two *main* categories, it'd be writing and programming. 
    - In regards to programming, I've always had an interest since I was in middle school, but life kept getting in the way. I'm glad to finally be putting in the effort. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
    - Currently, I'm going through front end web development. HTML + CSS are the current focus, but when I get into Javascript, I'll be sure to expand into the backend with Javascript and PHP or Go. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
    - Nothing currently. I want to be able to code at a certain level before committing to anothers project. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
    - TBD
